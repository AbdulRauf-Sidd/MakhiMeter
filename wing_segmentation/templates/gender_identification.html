                    <p align="justify"> One of the earliest and most prominent subjects for genetic research are fruit flies, or more specifically Drosophila melanogaster. 
                        Accurate identification of gender is one of the basics in a work on this group. There are some modest differences in body shape and size between genders. 
                        Adult males are nearly as small and thinner of build. The number and arrangement of a segments with open limbs are also suggestive gender. Often times, 
                        the female has a bolder more rounded abdomens with large oviposter. Gender identification in Drosophila melanogaster has been the prototype of genetic science. 
                        Researchers are able to quickly and reliably identify whether thousands of flies in a study group belong to one gender or the other, making it easier for them 
                        when they do their genetic research.

                                 The system is designed to recognize gender Male or Female  in Drosophila making it easier to visually interpret the gender of fruit fly. 
                                 This enhances the visual study of Drosophila gender, providing a more informative and detailed view for researchers.
